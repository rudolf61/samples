Some samples for my colleagues
These examples have been made for my colleagues. 

In my spare time I love to code and try out some concepts. Those concepts are not new, 
but they are simple enough to be understood directly.

Currently it contains two examples:

1. A wrapper for a DataSource (HikariCP) in order to control the Connections and ResultSets 
   so that the user does not have to think about cleaning up the resources.
   
2. Typed variation of Java's Properties. The type information is part of the property name and 
   is used to return the right type using Generics. 
   
Both examples have a simple happy flow unit test.
